Due to the Greg canon post, I decided to outline some thoughts about what a five act Gregiverse story might look like.  I've also made it a playlist for anyone interested.  It's on Apple Music because one of the songs is only available there (and because I don't support Spotify anymore).  [The Gregiverse on Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/the-gregiverse/pl.u-9N9LX8eT756lJ4).

# Act I
Greg has just gotten out of a bad relationship.  We showcase the stages of grief, namely: bargaining, depression, and finally acceptance (with a light sprinkling of anger thrown in).
* Mutiny Below
* Air-Conditioned Love
* Drunken Lament
* Good Will Hunting By Myself

And finally we introduce our characters, Greggory<sup>*</sup>, and Sara Elektra!
* Go-Getter Greg
* Elecktra's Complex


# Act II
Will Greg ever find someone to fire that gun on his hip?  Will Sara find her lollipop in Candyland or her caveman with a spear and dental plan?
* Hum Along
* Roxy
* Laundry Girl
* Sara's Song

While they are sickeningly adorable to everyone who sees them in public, their home-life has some problems.  Diagnosed, but untreated, the psychopathy evinced by both of characters is manifest in the following pieces.
* Love Me Dead

With such dysfunction, there must be some force driving this duo together.
* All the Stars in Texas

Greg it turns out, has a nasty habit.
* Lake Pontchartrain
* The Horror of our Love

Wow.  Greg.  A murderer.  Who would have thought?!<sup>†</sup>.  I guess we now know why even if they never shot a single one, all those years were so deadly...
As we heard before, one of our duo wants to take the other home and start a family, but is lured back into the life that's kept them close this whole time.


# Act III
After some years, the couple tires of the action.  It's time for a change of scenery.
* Japan It

Well, they do return.  They're looking to settle down.  Buy a two story house in a suburb of the Midwest.  The love felt for one another is unimaginable.
* Anything for You

With quite a bit of therapy and mood regulation, our leading two seem to be living the picturesque life!  Rings on their fingers signify that they've gotten married!  They pick up jobs to conceal their ill-gotten gains as the result of a life of corporate drudgery.  They even manage to work at the same place!  It's convenient and lets them carpool on the days their schedules overlap.

However, one day...one fateful day in May of 1989, Greg has nearly finished his week-long vacation.  Just prior he had finished an exhausting stint trying to make a deadline.  And he made it!  This week off was his chance to recuperate and be ready to jump into his next task.  But today, he had just a few more things to grab from the hardware store.  You see, their deck in the backyard needed some repairs.  To start off Greg's vacation they hosted a raging block party.  More than just the block showed up; a veritable crowd of people that neither Greg nor Sara knew were there.  But they didn't care.  This was such a liberating feeling!  They had to have gone through at least ten kegs of beer and the party started just after nine!  But between those kegs, the trampolines they foolishly set on the deck, and all the chaos, some of the deck boards were sagging and needed to be braced.

Sara, however, has a critical presentation to give today and decides to head in a little earlier than normal to rehearse her spiel just a few more times.


# Act IV
We cut to a new scene.  There's Greg, but older.  He has a fresh shave, and crisp clothes.  Worn, but not yet threadbare jeans.  A blank shirt peeking out from behind a crafter's apron.  Work boots.  A muscle in his eyelid twitches.  A single bead of sweat slips from a crease of his forehead and is caught by his eyebrow.  He sets a tool down, and steps forward.  All we see behind him are blueprints haphazardly taped and pinned to walls, none of which are comprehensible, and a stained mattress with blankets thrown into a pile at the bottom of it.  It's a stark contract to how presentable Greg appears.
* Pt. 1: Broken Bride

We cut to a scene from a future.  One that looks vaguely similar to ours, but definitely further in time than us as the audience exist.  We see a mid-sized city.  There appears to be an argument starting...
* Cyborgs vs. Robots

We cut a few more years into the future.  It's the same city, though only a shell of its former self.  Alas, no more robots exist.  Perhaps if they did, the current situation would not be as dire.
* Save our City

Greg enters the scene.
* Pt. 2: Tonight's the Night
* Pt. 3: The Lamb and the Dragon
* Pt. 4: Morning in May


# Act V
Greg and Sara's story doesn't end just yet however.  Just because they have no need for their flesh, does that mean that they won't be written about.  In fact, their previous escapades have made them famous within a certain undead community and a number have asked to join in their following shenanigans!
* Skeletons on Parade
* Rotten Town
* Scare Me

And finally, we end with:
* Skeleton's Lullaby

<sup>*</sup>: Why Greggory with two g's in the middle?  Because in an alternate universe at some point in his life he ends up dwelling in a deep cavern under Black Lake, desperate to be the most famous funk player ever!<br />
<sup>†</sup>: I mean, at a minimum, I did, thanks to Andrew... so that's two people at least!
